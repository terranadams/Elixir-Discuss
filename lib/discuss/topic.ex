# a struct for this model file was created automatically, run iex -S mix and then run 'struct = %Discuss.Topic{}' to see it, which starts empty...
# then run 'params = %{title: "Great JS"}' to make a params object/map to be added to 'struct'...
# then we call our changeset function with both those arguments. 'Discuss.Topic.changeset(struct, params)'...
# changeset is not only a function, it's the name of the new struct that gets returned when we run the line above.
# the thing that gets saved to the db is the changeset struct that gets returned.
