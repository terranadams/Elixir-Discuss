# ********************************* IMPORTANT INFO FOR v1.3 of Phx
# You will need to manually add your model to the following path (note the different use/imports):
# lib/discuss/topic.ex
# defmodule Discuss.Topic do
#   use Ecto.Schema
#   import Ecto.Changeset

#   schema "topics" do
#     field :title, :string
#   end
# end
# In v1.3 you will normally run a different command that will generate the model and migration for you.
# mix phx.gen.schema Topic topics title:string
